# Roadmap

## Radar toggle!
Allows the player to see where the cheese are in the entire map

## Map power!
Forgot what this one was about... maybe power ups?

## Leap!
Allow the player to either jump over walls or jump away from danger quickly

## Cat has BRAINS?!?!
Give the cat an AI (potentially 3 for difficulty reasons) so they stop walking around the maze brainlessly

## Blind spots
Make looking over a wall impossible, adding to the challenge.

## Constantly changing map
The map changes constantly, making the player's improvising skills the key to getting the high score. That and probably luck.
